### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make an overlay with a hover, it honestly took me a hot minute,
but also, I wanted to do the correct version with pseudo before and after but I
wasn't able to. I will have to read more and implement that change, and oh gosh,
I need to change the way the card is. But, really I think its alright for
sharing now.

### Continued development

More work on the hover state, as well as accessibility for screenreaders, its
actually not set up at all.
